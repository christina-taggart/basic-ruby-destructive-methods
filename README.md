# Ruby Drill Destructive Methods

##Learning Competencies

##Summary

 The fundamental way that programmers organize their code is by writing methods. Methods (the code you write between `def` and `end`) have input, output, and side-effects.

A method's input is the arguments you pass in, such as in `puts "hi mom"`, where the `puts` method's input is the argument "hi mom". The `puts` method takes input, but only ever returns `nil` as output. Its side-effect is that it writes to STDOUT. On the other hand, many methods have no side-effects (also known as functions) and are purely input/output. For example, `File.exists?("app/models")` takes `"app/models"` as input, and returns `true` or `false`.

One of the conventions that you'll learn in Ruby is that methods with side-effects are appended with a `!` (what programmers call a "bang"). This helps future programmers calling these methods understand that when they call it, something serious is happening behind the scenes.

For this exercise, you will write a function (a method with no side-effects), and then a method with the side-effect of "destroying" its input argument.

*Note: the bang `!` symbol is used because permanently modifying data is dangerous. Use destructive methods with caution.*

### Rules for your method

You will be writing two versions of a method called `destroy_message` which takes in a string identified by the variable `message` and modifies that string based upon the following rules:

* A message is a string that may or may not contain a `":"`
* If the original message contains a `":"` then all content after (but not including) the `":"` is removed when the message self-destructs. So if the original message is `"This message will self destruct: Ruby is fun"` then the destructed message is `"This message will self destruct:"`.
* If the original message does not contain a `":"` then it will not change in when it is destructed.

### Writing methods with no side effects

Start by writing the `destroy_message` method following the rules outlined above. It **must not** permanently alter the original string passed in.

What does that mean? Here is an example of a *non-destructive* method:

```ruby
name = "Mr. Billy Jones"

# The String#sub method replaces one part of the string
# with another and returns the new, modified string.
name.sub('Jones', 'Jimmy Jones')
# => "Mr. Billy Jimmy Jones"

# But it does NOT permanently change the string, as we
# can see here:
name
# => "Mr. Billy Jones"
```

### Destroying everything!

Now, write the method `destroy_message!` which does the same thing as `destroy_message` (without the `!`) **except** that this new method will permanently modify the original string.

What does it mean to permanently modify a piece of data? Here is an example of a *destructive* method:

```ruby
name = "Mr. Billy Jones"

# The String#sub! method replaces one part of the ORIGINAL
# string with another and returns the modified string.
name.sub!('Jones', 'Jimmy Jones')
# => "Mr. Billy Jimmy Jones"

# When you call #sub! on a string, it permanently modifies
# the original value.
name
# => "Mr. Billy Jimmy Jones"
```
